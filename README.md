# Work-Day-Scheduler-Challenge-5

## Description

The objective of this challenge was to work with jQuery and Day.js to implement a day scheduler.
This is unfinished as I was able to display the current day in the header, set up timeblocks for the calendar,
color code the timeblocks based on the time in the day.
I am still working on capturing the text input and saving to local storage.

## Usage

I have included a screenshot of the calendar page albeit with the past time color code for all timeblocks.
